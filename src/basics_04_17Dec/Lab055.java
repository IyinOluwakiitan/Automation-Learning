 //Triangle Classifier
 //Write a program that classifies a triangle based on its side lengths
//Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides, determine
//if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal)
//isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or
//scalene (no sides are equal).
//use an if-else statement to classify the triangle

//side 1, side 2, side 3 - side1 = side2 = side3 This is equilateral triangle
//(side1 = side2) or side2 = side3 - it is isosceles
//if no side is equal then it is scalene which is an else condition
